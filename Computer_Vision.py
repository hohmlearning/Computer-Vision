def otsu (img_np):
    '''
    Calculate the Otsu's threshold for an image.
    
    This function implements Otsu's method [1] for automatic thresholding. It finds the 
    threshold that maximizes the inter-class variance and minimizes the intra-class 
    variance, i.e., the variance within each class of pixels (those above and those below the threshold). 
    The function is designed to work with images represented as 2D NumPy arrays of unsigned integer 
    type. It raises a TypeError if the image is not of an unsigned integer type. If the 
    image contains only one unique intensity, the function returns this value as the 
    threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_np : np.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array representing the image. The array should be of an unsigned integer type.
    
    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Raised if `img_np` is not of an unsigned integer type.
    
    Returns
    -------
    threshold_otsu : int or np.uint
        The computed Otsu's threshold. This is an intensity value that separates the image
        into two classes (foreground and background) in a way that minimizes the intra-class 
        variance.
    unique_intensivity : np.ndarray
        An array containing the unique intensity values present in the image.
    frequencies : np.ndarray
        An array containing the corresponding frequencies of the unique intensity values in the image.
    var_between : np.ndarray
        An array containing the inter-class variances for each threshold considered during Otsu's method.
